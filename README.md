Use this app to take input time, out time time and/or break time, to display your time in a decimal format, rounded to the second decimal place.

This app will also store the hours in a SQLite database, as well as let you view it and calculate total pay, and how many hours are stored, and the total hours of all the hours combined.

It also has various customization options to make the app suit your needs. 

Has an activity that displays a graph to visualize the hours yuo have worked on a bar graph.

I created this app in order to help me calculate my hours at work.
